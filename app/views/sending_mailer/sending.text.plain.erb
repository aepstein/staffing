According to our records, your renewal preferences are as follows:

<% @sending.user.memberships.pending_renewal_within(@sending.message.starts_at, @sending.message.ends_at).each do |membership| -%>
 <% if membership.request && membership.request.ends_at <= membership.ends_at -%>
 * You are *not* interested in reappointment to <%= membership.request.requestable %> after your current membership ends on <%= membership.ends_at.to_s :long_ordinal %>.
 <% elsif membership.request -%>
 * You are interested interested in reappointment to <%= membership.request.requestable %> from after your current membership ends on <%= membership.ends_at.to_s :long_ordinal %> until <%= membership.request.ends_at.to_s :long_ordinal %>.
 <% else -%>
 <% unless membership.position.requestables.empty? -%>
 * You are *not* interested in reappointment to <%= membership.position.requestables.join ', ' %> after your membership ends on <%= membership.ends_at.to_s :long_ordinal %>.
 <% end -%>
 <% end -%>
<% end -%>
